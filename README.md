Blank Macintosh images for BlueSCSI and RaSCSI.
Originally created for ArdSCSIno (BlueSCSI's father) and the original japanese RaSCSI, these images work without problems with BlueSCSI (I used my handmade 1.1a board to test them).
These images were created and formatted with a patched version of the Apple HD SC Setup and my SCSI2SD v5.
Change the extension and rename the hardfile accordingly to the BlueSCSI syntax.

Available sizes: 1 GB, 2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB.

NOTE: BlueSCSI isn't friendly with Apple HD SC Setup, so, if you want to reformat these images completely, use the newer Apple Drive Setup, LaCie Silverlining or Transoft SCSI Director.
