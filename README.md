Blank Macintosh images for BlueSCSI and RaSCSI.
Originally created for ArdSCSIno (BlueSCSI's father) and the original japanese RaSCSI, these images SHOULD work without problem with BlueSCSI.
These images were formatted with a patched version of the Apple HD SC Setup.
Change the extension and rename the hardfile accordingly to the BlueSCSI syntax.

Available sizes: 1 GB, 2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB.
