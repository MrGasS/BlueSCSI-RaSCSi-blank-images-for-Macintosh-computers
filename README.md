This is my own collection of blank Macintosh images for BlueSCSI and RaSCSI.

Change the extension and rename the hardfile accordingly to the BlueSCSI or RaSCSI syntax.

pce-macplus = image formatted with pce-macplus emulator.  
softmac = image formatted with SoftMac emulator.  
bluescsiapr22 = image formatted with a BlueSCSI on April 2022 firmware.  
scsi2sd = SD card formatted with a real Macintosh and a SCSI2SD, then imaged with DD on Debian.
