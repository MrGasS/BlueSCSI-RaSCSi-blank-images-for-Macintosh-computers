This is my own collection of blank Macintosh images for BlueSCSI and RaSCSI.

Change the extension and rename the hardfile accordingly to the BlueSCSI syntax.

pce-macplus = image formatted with pce-macplus emulator.  
softmac = image formatted with SoftMac emulator.  
scsi2sd = SD card formatted with a real Macintosh and a SCSI2SD, then imaged with DD on Debian.

NOTE: BlueSCSI isn't friendly with Apple HD SC Setup, so, if you want to completely reformat these images and replace the old Apple HD SC driver, use the newer Apple Drive Setup, LaCie Silverlining, LIDO or Transoft SCSI Director.
